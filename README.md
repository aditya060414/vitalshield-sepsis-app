📖 About The Project
VitalShield is a machine learning-powered web application designed to predict the risk of sepsis in ICU patients. It provides a simple, high-fidelity prototype interface for clinicians to input a patient's latest vital signs and lab results, receiving an immediate, actionable risk score (e.g., "HIGH RISK" or "LOW RISK").
